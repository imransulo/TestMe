# TestMe
TestMe is a new project which aims online examination. Nowadays, everything and everyone is constantly online. People find it easier and more comfortable to sort things out through technology. Because of this and because of how covid-19 has impacted our everyday life, we thought of the idea of a program that enables the online examination.
This application will conduct digitally exams and will make easier the evaluation of students academic knowledge. With some simple configuration, teachers & professors can create an exam using multiple choice questions or open questions.

Even though this program opposes the traditional way of which we used to take exams, we listed the benefits of using 'TestMe'.

THE BENEFITS:
1. Automatic evaluation: the process of evaluation is easier and faster because it is automated. Student like it better because they do not have to wait too long for the results. Teachers prefer it too, because it is less time consuming than the traditional way.
2. Cost effective: When taking conventional exam, there is a higher consume of question papers and answer sheets than online examination. Thus, online exams reduce these expenses.
3. Respects social distancing (covid-19): we are living through a pandemic and everything is unpredictable. Online exams prevent the spread of the virus and protect our lives.
4. It is more secure: since the exam is stored in a database there is no chance for a paper leakage. Also the system will store the exam directly and it can be visible only to the student who took it in anytime.
5. Motivation: each time a student correctly completes more than 85% of the exam, he/she is awarded with a certificate. We want this certificate to be a source of motivation for every learner. Studies show that when certificates are removed from the learning platform, exam results drop by almost 50%.
